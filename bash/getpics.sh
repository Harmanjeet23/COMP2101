# this script puts some picture files into a Pictures directory in our home directory
# it does some error testing
# it summarizes the Pictures directory when it is done
#

# Task 1: Improve this script to also retrieve and install the files kept in the https://zonzorp.net/pics.tgz tarfile
#   - use the same kind of testing that is already in the script to only download the tarfile if you don't already have it and  to make sure the download and extraction commands work, then delete the local copy of the tarfile if the extraction was successful

#making a Pictures directory in our home directory.
test -d ~/Pictures || mkdir ~/Pictures

# download a zipfile of pictures to our Pictures directory if it isn't already there - assumes you are online
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.zip || wget -q -O ~/Pictures/pics.zip http://zonzorp.net/pics.zip
#downloading tar file of pictures to our Pictures directory if there's nothing
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.tgz || wget -q -O ~/Pictures/pics.tgz https://zonzorp.net/pics.tgz

# unpack the downloaded zipfile if it is there, then delete the local copy of the zipfile
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.zip && unzip -d ~/Pictures -o -q ~/Pictures/pics.zip && rm ~/Pictures/pics.zip
#unpacking the tarfile and delete the local copy of that tar after extracting it
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.tgz && tar -xzf ~/Pictures/pics.tgz -C ~/Pictures && rm ~/Pictures/pics.tgz

# Make a report on what we have in the Pictures directory
test -d ~/Pictures && cat <<EOF
